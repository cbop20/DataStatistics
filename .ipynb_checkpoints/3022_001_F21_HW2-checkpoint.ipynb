    "This assignment is due on Canvas (as .ipynb) and Gradescope (as a .pdf) by **MIDNIGHT on Mon 13 Sep**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "- Any relevant data sets should be available on Canvas. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",

Here is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.  I also recommend the [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) for LaTex.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do **Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All** as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- 45 points of this assignment are in problems.  The remaining 5 are for neatness, style, and overall exposition of both code and text.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",

    "**Typset your solution here:** \n",
    "1)Months seem to have a very consitant mean around 5% but a great variance in outliers, especially in May and April, who probably aquired the outliers from the initial burst of covid shutdowns in the spring of 2020. Region 1, Region 3, and Region 4 have similar data, although the appearance of Region 4s plot is affected by an outlier around %30. Region 2 happens to have a smaller mean which may be due to the types of jobs that were more heavily affected by Covid. Things like transportation and manufactoring of goods. For this type of data I believe regions to be more important as it shows some significant differenes in mean for Region 2 from the other regions. Something not seen in the differences between months. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Regions is a good grouping as there are often differences in census data based on area. Perhaps going further and differentiating by state could show some interesting data to see which states were hit the hardest by covid/have taken the longest to recover once the 2021 census is finished, or which states generally have the highest unemployment rates. If you graphed states by month you could also potentially view mass migration of homeless individuals from warmer places in the winter to cooler states in the summer."
